# SWN Character Generator

# How to run (DEV):
- In a terminal at /server:                 npm start
- In another terminal at /server/client:    npm start
- Starting the client will launch a browser. To manually visit the app, go to localhost:3000

# How to run (PROD):
- Build the client at /server/client:       npm run build
- Run the server at /server:                npm start
- Visit the app at localhost:5000

# Working method:
- Work is tracked in Trello: https://trello.com/b/AFs1wFcp/final-year-project
- Agile sprints are used with a length of 2 weeks, tracked very casually in Trello
- Working features will be commited to a "release" branch every other Friday, at the end of each sprint
- After the initial setup, features will be developed on their own branches and merged in after testing
- This ensures I can release a working build every other Friday by isolating potentially buggy features
