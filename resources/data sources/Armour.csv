Armour,Shield,Shield ,1,,0,1,10,"Shields are an ancient yet extremely useful adjunct to
body armor. Primitive shields are usually of wood or stretched hide, while more modern riot shields tend toward clear plastic. A force pavis is more effective, being a small pretech force disc projector that can absorb all manner of small arms fire. All shields require one free hand to use effectively.
Shields grant a base AC to their user; 13 for primitive and riot shields, and 15 for a force pavis. If the bearer's AC is already equal or better, the shield simply grants a +1 AC bonus. Primitive and riot shields are ignored by all weapons that ignore primitive armor. Aside from their AC benefit, a shield also renders the bearer immune to the first instance of melee Shock damage they take each round, assuming the shield is effective against the weapon being used.",

Armour,Body,Warpaint,12,,4,0,300,"Warpaint is the common term for the bizarre combat fashions and scrap-built street harness of gangers, cult enforcers, street toughs, and other marginal sorts with little money but much need for protection. Most warpaint is fashioned of scrounged scraps of TL4 materials that are exceptionally tough or rigid, filled out with gang colors, body paint, intimidating tattoos, and the usual threatening grimace. It is often exceedingly impractical but inspirational to its wearer; an NPC in warpaint that is meaningful to them gains a +1 Morale bonus. Most warpaint is either pieced together over years or taken from the dead. Actually purchasing a finished suit comes at the listed price, assuming someone can be found willing to part with theirs.",
Armour,Body,Dermal Armour,16,,4,0,20000,"A fine subcutaneous reinforcement mesh provides significant protection against impacts and cuts while remaining imperceptible to
anything short of a medical examination. Someone with a dermal mesh is immune to Shock damage inflicted by primitive melee weapons. A
TL5 version of this implant that costs five times as much grants even more protection, rendering the subject wholly immune to primitive weapons
as if they were wearing a suit of powered armor.",
Armour,Body,Woven Body Armor,15,,3,2,400,"Woven body armor represents the best armor that a TL3 world can manufacture, or an up-armored version of security armor used by TL4 high-threat response teams. The design is significantly more cumbersome,
but allows for multiple layers of protection.",
Armour,Body,Ship Suit,11,,4,0,75,"The standard uniform aboard military spacecraft, a ship suit is usually marked with its wearer’s name, rank, and personnel number. While a ship suit provides no armor class benefit, it’s designed to serve as an emergency pressure suit in case of a hull breach. It can serve as a vacc suit for up to six hours on one type A power cell, and has integral oxygen supplies and heat sufficient
for that time. Ship suits are very fragile compared to normal vacc suits, however, and even exceptionally wild exertions run the risk of tearing them- every hit on a person wearing a ship suit has a 50% chance of tearing it, with normal patching rules applied. Ship suits cannot be worn beneath armor.",
Armour,Body,Vacc Suit,13,,4,1,100,The Encumbrance does NOT include an Oxygen Tank!,
Armour,Body,Armored Vacc Suit,13,,4,2,400,"An armored vacc suit has traded off some comfort and flexibility for additional protective thickness. Aside
from functioning as a normal vacc suit, it has only half the usual chance to tear when hit by an edged weapon or suit ripper. The choice between armored or standard suits is a common debate in spacer bars.",
Armour,Body,Armored Undersuit,13,,4,0,600,An armored undersuit is a skin-tight bodysuit woven of advanced TL4 fibers with exceptional shock-activated rigidity and impact dispersion capabilities. Transparent panels allow for it to be worn with almost any outfit without drawing notice or being detected without a close tactile examination.,
Armour,Body,Secure Clothing,13,,4,1,300,"Secure clothing comes in assorted styles and fashions ranging from casual street wear to haute couture. Normal fabrics and components are replaced with light, flexible armor components that are only slightly hindering to the wearer. Only close tactile examination
can distinguish secure clothing from ordinary couture.",
Armour,Body,Comet Suit,14,,4,2,6000,"A favored infiltration tool for Deep Black agents, a comet suit allows a subject to survive an orbital drop onto a planet’s
surface, the thick sheathing of the suit peeling away as ablation under the heat of reentry. An integral chute system allows the wearer to brake during the final stage of re-entry, but the degree of imprecision in landing is very high- usually 1d20-1 x 40 kilometers away from the target point in a random direction, even assuming the initial drop trajectory was well-placed. For this reason, dandelion chutes are usually paired with comet suits when precision in landing
is important. The suits themselves provide AC 6, but any activity while wearing them that isn’t related to jumping out of a spaceship takes a -2 skill check and -4 on hit rolls. Comet suits can be used only once before requiring 2,000 credits worth of refurbishing.",
Armour,Body,Force Pavis,15,,5,1,10000,A force pavis is a small pretech force disc projector that can absorb all manner of small arms fire.,
Armour,Body,Security Armour,14,,5,1,700,Security armor is the ordinary working uniform of most law enforcement officials and security personnel. Various rigid plates and anti-ballistic panels provide protection for the wearer at minimal extra weight.,
Armour,Body,Icarus Harness,16,,4,1,8000,"The Icarus harness is a CFU upgrade for paratroopers, and replaces a conventional parachute with a crude gravity damper that allows the wearer to fall an unlimited distance without harm. Each fall over 3
meters drains a type A power cell. The suit also functions as a vacc suit for up to 30 minutes per vacc refresh.",
Armour,Body,Combat Field Uniform,16,,4,1,1000,"A combat field uniform is sophisticated battle dress
fabricated from TL4 ablative coatings, rigid plates, and shock-activated soft components. The CFU is the standard military uniform for TL4 front-line soldiers.",
Armour,Body,Vestimentum,18,,5,0,15000,"A ""vestimentum"" is a catch-all term for one of the many ancient Mandate ceremonial armors meant chiefly for parade guards, ritual officiants, cultural
reenactors, or other roles that put elaborate style at a premium. While these outfits often look wildly unmilitary, their hyper-advanced components and micronized force fields give them the same protection against primitive weapons as any other powered armor.",
Armour,Body,Assault Suit,18,,4,2,10000,"An assault suit represents the most sophisticated armor in common use among TL4 worlds. An assault suit requires a type B power cell for 24 hours of operation, and provides integral encrypted military comms, low-light and infrared vision, and a built-in energy
feed interface. The latter allows the wearer to connect the suit to any one weapon or device that uses a type A power cell as a Main Action. So long as the device remains connected to the suit, it is treated as having
unlimited ammunition or operation time. The suit also functions as a vacc suit so long as it remains powered, one that cannot be torn by edged weapons.",
Armour,Body,Storm Armour,19,4,5,2,20000,"Storm armor is a more advanced form of assault
suit, one that can be fabricated only by those worlds that have retained some degree of Mandate-grade technical infrastructure. Aside from functioning as an assault suit, the storm armor's exo-augments allow the wearer to treat their Strength as 4 points higher for encumbrance purposes. Integral gravitic boosters allow the wearer to leap up to 20 meters as a Move action, either horizontally or vertically, and allow the wearer
to fall up to 40 meters without suffering harm. An onboard medical computer can attempt last-ditch stabilization of the wearer if all other efforts fail; when the wearer would normally die from an untreated mortal wound, they can make a Physical save to self-stabilize.
Storm armor requires the same type B power cell as an assault suit, and each cell powers it for 24 hours.",
Armour,Body,Field Emitter Panoply,20,,5,1,40000,"A field emitter panoply is a heavy-duty pretech defensive system composed of a half-dozen worn emitter nodes that sheath the wearer in a nimbus of close-fitting damper fields. The FEP's pale glow is obvious,
but it provides all the benefits of storm armor with no power source required. The FEP is particularly effective at filtering radiation, and renders the wearer immune to any dose that wouldn't kill them in seconds. Many FEPs project intimidating holographic skins over the wearer when in operation.",
Armour,Body,Deflector Array,18,,5,0,30000,"A deflector array consists of several force field nodes worn beneath ordinary clothing. The invisible shield it produces flares only when dangerous energies or impact is impending, glowing a brief, bright blue as it deflects the attack.",
