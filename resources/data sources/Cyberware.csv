Adrenal Suppression Pump,4,1,30000,"Adrenal Suppression Pump: These endocrine pumps neutralize numerous brain chemicals in the user when activated while exciting the user’s perceptual centers. This combination produces a cold, dispassionate situational awareness that grants the user +2 on initiative rolls when the system is engaged. Most systems have built-in safety overrides to prevent psychological addiction and brain damage, allowing the unit to be used for no more than an hour each day. The user takes a -2 penalty on all social skill checks while the unit is active,
and it requires five rounds to toggle it."
Bioadaptation Augments,4,1,10000,"Bioadaptation Augments: These additional synthetic organs and filters allow the bearer to survive in thin atmosphere conditions, as well as tolerate temperatures ranging from Antarctic chill to heat sufficient to boil water. They can also eat a wide range of native life forms for sustenance; no normal planet's native biology is ever considered imiscible for consumption."
Body Arsenal Array,4,1,10000,"Body Arsenal Array: Some personnel need to be armed at all times without giving any indication of such. Improvised weaponry and conventional holdout weapons are useful enough against soft targets, but disabling a target in powered armor requires more. The details of the array vary from user to user, but usually act as advanced medium weapons
that can be used with either Punch or Stab skills and at least one integral energy projector equal to a laser rifle, one that must be powered by an insertable type A power cell. Retracted body arsenals can be detected only by a medical examination."
Body Sculpting,4,1,10000,"Body Sculpting: Not so much a single implant as a series of complex surgeries, body sculpting is available on many TL4 worlds with fairly advanced medical services. After a week of alterations and treatments a subject's external appearance can be set within any human or near-human range, including full retinal and fingerprint matching to a desired target. A TL5 version of this treatment that costs ten times as much can involve extensive
DNA reprogramming to change the subject at a genetic level, making their alterations heritable and allowing female-targeted shapes to bear offspring. Neither treatment is reversible, and any further major alterations require further permanent System Strain."
Dermal Armour,4,2,20000,"Dermal Armor: A fine subcutaneous reinforcement mesh provides significant protection against impacts and cuts while remaining imperceptible to anything short of a medical examination. Someone with a dermal mesh is immune to Shock damage inflicted by primitive melee weapons. A TL5 version of this implant that costs five times as much grants even more protection, rendering the subject wholly immune to primitive weapons as if they were wearing a suit of powered armor."
Drone Control Link,4,1,20000,"Drone Control Link: Most often found among military bot wranglers, civilians can also get a drone control link implanted to simplify the remote piloting of drones and other robotic units.
Users of a link can issue commands to a drone as a Move action instead of a Main Action. A
single drone can only receive one command per round, however. Aside from this ease of command, someone with an implanted rig can ""look"" through a piloted drone's sensors as an Instant action, and a drone is never considered to be out of control even if the pilot doesn't spend a Main Action controlling it. A link can maintain a connection with one drone at a time, plus the user's Program skill."
Eelskin Capacitor Mesh,4,1,25000,"Eelskin Capacitor Mesh: A hair-fine mesh of almost imperceptible wiring along the user’s palms and fingers allow them to trigger brief, controlled bursts of electrical energy at targets within five meters. As an Instant action it adds 2d4 non-lethal damage to a successful Punch attack. In its intended use, it also allows the user to override and disable most electronic locks and security systems with a successful Sneak or Fix skill check. Both triggering a burst and hacking a security system tax the user’s biology; one System Strain point is gained with each attack or skill check."
Gecko Anchors,4,1,15000,"Gecko Anchors: Miniaturized gravitic manipulators are embedded in the subject's hands and feet as part of this complex surgery. While they are too weak to allow levitation or damping fall damage, they can twist localized gravity around those limbs to anchor the subject to the nearest surface capable of bearing their weight. As a result, the user can freely run or climb up sheer surfaces at their normal movement rate, carrying no more than their normal maximum encumbrance."
Ghost Talker Transceiver,4,1,15000,"Ghost Talker Transceiver: Some people simply cannot afford to be out of contact at any time, under any circumstances. Those people find use for the microfine web of radio wiring and optical augmentation that make up the ghost talker. These units act as a built-in compad for the user and allow for reception and transmission of audio and visual recordings, the latter playing in an inset window in the user’s field of vision. If the unit is operating outside of a standard comm grid, it has a transmission range of twenty kilometers and a recep-
tion range of one hundred. Ghost talker users can transmit basic visual diagrams and images to each other, as well as optical recordings."
Holdout Cavity,4,1,10000,"Holdout Cavity: Usually implanted somewhere in the torso, a holdout cavity is a small recess shaped into the wearer’s body and designed to be overlooked by most standard forms of medical or security scanning. It automatically defeats a security inspection that uses less than TL4 scanners, and even advanced tech requires careful personal inspection to have a chance of revealing it. The cavity can hold an object up to the size of a pistol and is opened and shut by the user’s mental command."
Holoskin Emitters,4,1,15000,"Holoskin Emitter: Multiple holographic emitters are implanted on the user, allowing them to alter their external appearance to match anything of their approximate size and dimensions, including other people. Shifting appearances is a Main Action, and the user can't shift to an appearance that isn't in the cyberware's shape library. The library is vast and contains ""generic"" examples of numerous human-sized objects and people, but mimicking a specific other person requires at least five minutes of close examination. The holograms projected
by the emitters are good, but imperfect; anyone who closely examines the user will be able to tell that something is artificial about their appearance, and touch instantly confirms any suspicions. The emitters can fake clothing and can produce sounds to complement the illusion or modify the user's voice, if records of the true subject are available. The disguise lasts until the user dies or ends it. "
Identity Submersion Trigger,4,1,25000,"Identity Submersion Trigger: This cyberware involves micronized neural stimulation technology which is imperceptible to anything short of TL5 medical scanning or TL4 surgical examination of the subject's brain tissue. When active, the IST allows the subject to adopt a secondary persona, complete with a library of manufactured memories. So long as the IST is active, the subject will honestly and completely believe himself to be the secondary persona, a conviction that cannot be penetrated by telepathy or TL4 methods of interrogation. The
persona can be activated at the user's discretion, but it only deactivates on a preset trigger, leaving the subject in full possession of all memories experienced. The trigger can be any perceptible stimulus: a particular time, the sight of a specific person, a code phrase, or any other sign, and it may be changed by the user each time they activate the cyberware. Many ISTs are also implanted with a ""master key"" that will automatically deactivate the trigger, a key controlled by the agency responsible for the implant."
Immunofiltration System,4,2,25000,"Immunofiltration Systems: This broad-spectrum scrub system carefully identifies and contains toxic substances introduced into the user's system. Whenever the subject would normally have to make a saving throw to resist some disease or toxin, they may instead gain one System Strain to automatically succeed on the save. Most of these systems are calibrated to automatically filter any toxins or chemicals in standard use by police or military
forces in the sector, but if presented with a special biowarfare toxin, the filters are less effective. In such cases, the most it can do is either grant a second saving throw if the first is failed, or grant a single saving throw if none is normally allowed."
Induced Coma Trigger,4,1,20000,"Induced Coma Trigger: A series of implants are wired to the user’s brain stem, allowing them to trigger an induced therapeutic coma at a mental command. The user appears dead to anything short of a medical inspection, and has no need of respiration, food, or water while the coma is in effect. The user does not heal while in a coma, but any diseases or poisons also halt progression. The user determines how long the coma is to last before triggering it, and is unconscious for its duration. A character can survive in a coma up to two weeks before needing to regain consciousness for as long as they were in the coma."
Neurointruder Alert,5,1,50000,"Neurointruder Alert: While somewhat primitive by pretech standards, this TL5 cybernetic implant allows the wearer to gain a +3 bonus on all saving throws to resist telepathic intrusion. Even if such a save is failed, the user will be aware that they are under telepathic assault, though some forms of mental control may not allow them to say as much until after the influence is ended. The warning does not indicate the source of the influence."
Panspectral Optics,4,1,15000,"Panspectral Optics: Ocular adjustments to the wearer allow them to see clearly at any light level short of perfect darkness, in addition to giving them thermal vision that can easily distinguish shapes and distance even in the total absence of light. Dangerous radiation and lasers tuned outside the range of visible light are also visible to the user. Nearby radio transmissions can be seen as if they were visual flares of color. The system cannot translate these transmissions, only alert the user to them."
Pressure Sheathing,4,1,15000,"Pressure Sheathing: Occasionally purchased by workers in hard vacuum or other hostile environments, pressure sheathing integrates an ultrathin pressure membrane with the user’s dermis and emergency film sealants that trigger at the user’s mental command. The pressure sheathing serves as an emergency vacc suit with an integral oxygen supply and temperature regulators that can sustain them for up to thirty minutes. A pressure sheath
needs 48 hours to regain structural integrity and power after triggering. A pressure sheath can be detected only by a close medical examination."
Prosthetic Limb,4,1,2500,"Prosthetic Limb: Hands, feet, arms, legs, eyes, and numerous internal organs can be replicated by postech medical science. These prosthetics can provide a good approximation of the sense of touch, and are usually impossible to distinguish from ordinary limbs without close inspection. Pretech-level worlds tend to prefer actually regenerating lost limbs, but those with access only to ordinary frontier levels of tech have reason to be grateful to prosthetics."
Revenant Wiring,5,3,50000,"Revenant Wiring: One of the more grotesque results of late pretech augmentation research, revenant wiring permeates the user’s body with a web of supplementary limb actuators and sensor clusters. In combat, the user may designate up to a half-dozen targets to the system’s braked micro-AI. If the user goes unconscious or is killed, the micro-AI will engage the limb actuators to keep fighting, even if the user is nothing more than a ragged mass of mangled tissue. The micro-AI is not brilliant, but it is capable of negotiating most terrain and
dealing with physical impediments to killing the designated targets. The actuators have power to keep operating for 3d4 rounds, or until the wearer takes 25 more hit points of damage, whichever comes first. The stress produced by revenant wiring makes it much more difficult to revive a downed user with Lazarus patches or biopsionics; all revivification chances are half normal."
Slowtime Window,5,2,30000,"Slowtime Window: A piece of cutting-edge pretech cyberware, the slowtime window was installed in crisis responders and others reliant on split-second decision making. When engaged, the implants accelerate the user’s cogitation speed by more than three thousand percent. While there is no corresponding acceleration of the user’s physical reflex-
es, they have time to process the situation and take in its details. A person who triggers a slowtime window cannot be surprised; they always roll initiative as normal no matter how unexpected the attacker. This brain acceleration is highly stressful on the tissues, however, and one point of System Strain is gained each time it is engaged."
Stabilization Overrides,4,2,25000,"Stabilization Overrides: An intricate interweaving of microcapillaries and backup organs is implanted in the subject’s torso and spinal column. These overrides can stabilize the user when severe physical trauma would otherwise kill them. A user reduced to 0 hit points is automatically stabilized, as if a Lazarus patch had been successfully applied to them, assuming that a patch could have saved them. Stabilization overrides tend to interfere with the ordinary operation of the user’s organs, however, and the wearer’s Constitution modifier is lowered by 1, with all the attendant consequences in loss of maximum hit points."
Tagger Nanites,4,1,15000,"Tagger Nanites: While true nanotechnology is beyond the grasp of standard TL4 science, this cyber allows for the implantation of very simple nanofactories in the user, ones that exude a constant imperceptible ""smart dust"". Objects the user touches can be tagged by these nanites, which generate more of their kind for up to 48 hours after tagging. The dust then lays down a ""trail"" behind the tagged object, one that is visible to the user or to someone using a properly-keyed tracer. Only counter-nanite measures can remove the dust, as ordinary bathing or scrubbing is insufficient. The dust can be pinged by radio to announce its location to anyone within five kilometers, but most users prefer to leave the dust in passive mode, where it is undetectable to most TL4 sensors. Tagging an object adds one System Strain to the user."
Toxin Injector,4,2,20000,"Toxin Injector: The user's canines or fingernails are altered to allow for the injection of one of two types of poison. If the user attempts to inject an unsuspecting victim they are already touching, the attempt is automatically successful. If the victim is wary or in combat, they can only be affected if they are unarmored and the user succeeds in a Punch attack roll. On a success, the victim must make a Physical saving throw at -2 or be incapacitated by the poison, dying in 1d6 rounds or being incapacitated for 1d6 hours at the user's discretion. Each poison attack adds 2 System Strain to the user."
Twitchlock Actuators,4,2,30000,"Twitchlock Actuators: Neural override fibers are woven into the user’s hands and arms and linked to a perceptual modulator implanted at the base of the user’s brain stem. When presented with a direct exercise of hand-eye coordination, the twitchlock can be engaged to produce superhuman accuracy and precision. Any attack roll or skill check reliant chiefly on manual dexterity or aim can be rerolled, though the power surge inflicts two points of System Strain on the user. A given roll can only be rerolled once with this cyberware. While the twitchlock allows superhuman accuracy when engaged, the overrides fuzz ordinary nerve impulses and reduce the user’s Dexterity modifier by 1 when active. Activating or deactivating the cyberware requires a Main Action."
