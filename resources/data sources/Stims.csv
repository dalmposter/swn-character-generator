Bezoar,1,1,"Bezoar (Heal-1): A complex antibiotic cocktail, Bezoar is an effective default treatment for a wide variety of infectious diseases. When applied to a sufferer, roll 1d6; on a 1, this victim cannot be helped by Bezoar, while otherwise the affliction is cured within 24 hours. Each application of Bezoar adds 1 System Strain to the target, and it cannot cure cancers, bioweapons, or congenital diseases."
Hush,0,0,"Hush (Heal-0): An extremely heavy neurotranquilizer, Hush leaves the subject awake and responsive to simple, untaxing commands. They cannot fight or communicate while affected by Hush, but will walk, eat, sit, and perform simple actions as directed by the last person to speak to them. A Hush dose lasts for three hours per Heal level of the person applying the stim, and the subject retains no memories while under the effect. A subject must be immobilized or willing to be affected by Hush; violent physical movement immediately after application disrupts the neurological effects."
Lift,0,1,"Lift (Heal-0): A Lift stim augments and amplifies the body's natural response to physical injury and exhaustion. This boost speeds natural recovery drastically and heals 1d8 plus the user's Heal skill in hit points after five minutes of rest. Lift stims do not work on PCs who are mortally wounded; they need to be stabilized before the Lift can help them, though application to a stabilized target will get them back on their feet and active again. Each application adds 1 System Strain to the target. Each additional application of Lift to a target the same day increases the minimum Heal skill needed by 1."
Psych,-,1,"Psych (None): A military drug duplicated in rougher form by many street chemists, Psych fills the user with an intense sense of confidence and reckless courage. Unfortunately, it also cripples their judgment regarding danger. A person affected by Psych immediately gains a Morale score of 12 and a +1 bonus on all skill checks, but will ignore cover during combat and cannot decide not to attempt a skill check after learning its difficulty. The effect lasts fifteen minutes, adds 1 System Strain to the user, and is highly psychologically addictive."
Reverie,1,2,"Reverie (Heal-1): This very dangerous combat drug completely subdues the subject's fear centers and adrenaline production, leaving them perfectly calm and relaxed even in the midst of mortal danger. Their reaction speed is much slower as a consequence, and they may act only on even-numbered combat rounds; so on the second, fourth, and sixth rounds and so forth. Any damage they suffer is doubled as well due to their lack of vigilance. Their perfect calm allows them to shoot as if on the target range, however, and they can make
Dex/Shoot skill checks to hit a target instead of hit rolls; the difficulty is 7 at point blank, 9 at normal ranges, and 11 at long ranges for the weapon. The target's armor class is ignored. Melee attacks made under Reverie always hit. Reverie lasts for ten minutes and adds 2 System Strain to the target."
Squeal,1,0,"Squeal (Heal-1): This ""truth serum"" is unreliable but still one of the best available options for field interrogations. The subject must be immobilized or willing to be affected by it. For five minutes afterwards they will be unable to avoid answering questions about facts known to them; they will be unable to exercise anything resembling a hypothesis or a judgment, but they will answer specific questions about facts known to them truthfully. Unwilling victims can attempt a Physical saving throw; on a success, they can simply refuse to speak about one particular topic of their choice. Targets pass out for 1d6 hours after the drug wears off and are immune to it for a week thereafter."
Tsunami,1,2,"Tsunami (Heal-1): An emergency combat stim used to juice certain expendable soldiers before an assault, Tsunami fills them with a reckless disregard for pain and an intense aggressiveness. The short effect duration and difficult application limits its wider use, however. Subjects gain a Morale score of 12, 10 extra hit points for ten rounds and a +2
bonus on all hit rolls. At the end of the duration, they immediately lose 10 hit points, which may leave them mortally wounded. Each application adds 2 System Strain to the target."
