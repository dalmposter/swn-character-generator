,Psychic Succor,1D,Core,34,Biopsionics,"Activating Psychic Succor requires the biopsion to Commit Effort for the day. Once used, they can continue to use it for the rest of that scene without Committing Effort again.

Level-0: The psychic’s touch can automatically stabilize a critically-wounded target as a Main Action. This power must be used on a target within six rounds of their collapse, and does not function on targets that have been decapitated or killed by Heavy weapons. It’s the GM’s decision as to whether a target is intact enough for this power to work.

Level-1: As level-0, and heal 1d6+1 hit points of damage.
If used on a mortally-wounded target, they revive with the rolled hit points and can act normally the next round.

Level-2: As level-1, but healing 2d6+2 hit points instead.

Level-3: As level-2, but healing 2d6+4 hit points instead.

Level-4: As level-3, but healing 3d6+8 hit points instead."
1,Mastered Succor,0,Core,34,Biopsionics,"Level-1 required

The biopsion has developed a sophisticated mastery of their core ability, and they no longer need to Commit Effort to activate it. The use of additional techniques that augment Psychic Succor might still require Effort to be Committed."
1,Organic Purification Protocols,0,Core,34,Biopsionics,"Level-1 required

The biopsion’s Psychic Succor now cures any poisons or
diseases the subject may be suffering. Biowarfare organisms or TL5 toxins may resist this curing, requiring a Wis/Biopsionics skill check at a difficulty of at least 10. Failure means that the adept cannot cure the target."
1,Remote Repair,1E,Core,34,Biopsionics,"Psychic Succor and other biopsionic techniques that nor-
mally require touch contact can now be applied at a distance up to 100 meters, provided the biopsion can see the target with their unaided vision. Hostile power use with this technique requires the adept Commit Effort for the scene as an additional cost instead of making a hit roll."
2,Invincible Stand,1E,Core,34,Biopsionics,"Level-2 required

The biopsion has mastered techniques of emergency
tissue reinforcement and system stabilization. As an
Instant action, they can Commit Effort for the scene to keep themselves or a target they can touch active even at zero hit points. This technique must be used once every round on the target or they collapse at the end of the round. If the target suffers hit point damage, the biopsion must Instantly Commit Effort for the scene or the target goes down immediately with a mortal wound. A Heavy weapon hit on a subject of this power or similar physical dismemberment will always kill
a target, regardless of this technique."
2,Major Organ Restoration,0,Core,34,Biopsionics,"Level-2 required

The biopsion’s Psychic Succor can now cure congenital birth defects and regrow missing limbs and organs. It can even be used to stabilize targets that have been dropped by Heavy weapons, decapitated, or otherwise dramatically dismembered, provided it’s used within one round per level of Biopsionic skill. The best that
can be done for such badly-mangled targets is stabilization, after which they must rest for 24 hours before any further hit points can be healed."
2,Tissue Integrity Field,1D,Core,35,Biopsionics,"Level-2 required

The biopsion’s Psychic Succor may now also affect all allies within ten meters of the target. Allies can decline the healing if they don’t require it or don’t want to take the additional System Strain. Each use of this technique
requires that the biopsion Commit Effort for the day in addition to the cost of the Psychic Succor."
3,Metamorph,1~,Core,35,Biopsionics,"Level-3 Required

The biopsion can now shape their own or another willing target’s physical form as a Main Action, transforming a touched target into any humanoid form within 50% of their own mass. Claws and other body armaments can be fashioned equivalent to Light or Medium melee weapons, or innate armor equivalent to AC 13. Gills and other environmental-survival alterations are also viable at the GM’s discretion, but flight is a bridge too far for this power. A target can be impersonated down to the DNA level, provided a blood or hair sample is available. The use of this adds one System Strain point to the target that does not recover so long as the change is in effect. Applying this power to a target requires that the biopsion Commit Effort for as long as the change is to be maintained. If applied to another target, the power automatically ends if the psychic gets more than one hundred kilometers away."
3,Teratic Overload,1E,Core,35,Biopsionics,"Level-3 required

This use of biopsionics inflicts potentially-lethal damage on a touched target as a Main Action, and requires that the biopsion Commit Effort for the scene. The target suffers 1d6 damage per level of the psychic’s Biopsionics skill and must make a Physical saving throw. On a failure, the damage is tripled and the target is now affected by an obvious, lethal cancer that will kill them in 1d6 months. The cancer can be treated by a TL4 hospital or ship’s sick bay if managed within a month’s time. If the biopsion Commits Effort for the day instead, they can control the power sufficiently to do no hit point damage and create very subtle tumors, leaving the cancer undetectable without a TL4 medical examination. Such victims probably won’t even know they’ve been attacked by this power. Whether a success or failure, this power cannot be used on the same target more than once per scene."
3,Accelerated Succor,1D,Core,35,Biopsionics,"Level-3 required

The biopsion’s Psychic Succor now can be used as an On Turn power, albeit only once per round. By Committing an additional Effort for the day with each use, it can even be used as an Instant power, though it still can only be used once per round. Any surcharges for augmenting the succor apply normally, such as with Tissue Integrity Field or Major Organ Restoration."
4,Holistic Optimisation Patterning,1D,Core,35,Biopsionics,"Level-4 required

The biopsion gains the ability to drastically augment their own or a touched ally’s physical abilities as an On Turn action. This boost adds two points of System Strain to the target and gives them a +2 bonus to all Strength or Dexterity skill checks, hit rolls, and damage rolls along with 20 extra hit points. Any damage is taken off these temporary hit points first, and both the bonuses and any hit points in excess of the target’s maximum are lost at the end of the scene. Each invocation of this technique requires the biopsion to Commit Effort for the day, and this power cannot be used on a given target more than once per scene."
4,Quintessential Reconstruction,All,Core,35,Biopsionics,"Level-4 required

The biopsion becomes extremely difficult to kill, encoding their mind in a coherent pattern of MES energy coterminous with their realspace coordinates. If killed,
the psychic will regenerate from the largest remaining fragment of their body over 24 hours. This process maximizes their System Strain for one week. If
brought to zero hit points during this week, they die instantly and permanently. The psychic retains a vague awareness of their surroundings while “dead” and can postpone their regeneration for up to a week in order to avoid notice, but burial or entombment may result in a very short second life. Each use of this power inflicts one point of permanent attribute loss in an attribute of the biopsion’s choice."
,Psychic Refinement,0,Core,36,Metapsionics,"The metapsion gains improved mastery over their own powers and an innate sensitivity to the use of psionic abilities in their presence.

Level-0: The adept can visually and audibly detect the use of psychic powers. If both the source and target are visible to the metapsion, they can tell who’s using the power, even if it’s normally imperceptible. They gain a +2 bonus on any saving throw versus a psionic power.

Level-1: The metapsion’s maximum Effort increases by
an additional point.

Level-2: The adept can determine whether or not a
person is a psychic or has latent psionic abilities through one round of visual inspection. Their saving throw bonus against psionic powers increases to +3.

Level-3: The metapsion’s maximum Effort increases by
an additional point.

Level-4: The metapsion can perform a slightly safer
version of torching. Instead of rolling the torching damage die, they simply suffer 10 hit points of damage after torching is used. The damage occurs after the fueled power activates, allowing a psychic at low hit points to trigger a power before falling unconscious. This damage cannot be healed by anything but natural bed rest, though a psychic can be stabilized if this technique drops her to zero hit points."
1,Cloak Powers,1~,Core,36,Metapsionics,"Level-1 required

The metapsion can conceal their own psychic abilities from metapsionic senses. They must Commit Effort for as long as they wish to cloak a their powers. While hidden, only a metapsion with equal or higher skill in Metapsionics can detect their abilities with their level-0
or level-2 Psychic Refinement abilities. In such cases, an
opposed Wis/Metapsionics roll is made between the metapsion and the investigator. If the investigator wins, the cloak is pierced, while if the metapsion wins, the investigator’s Psychic Refinement remains oblivious."
1,Mindtracing,1E,Core,36,Metapsionics,"Level-1 required

The metapsion can trace back the use of psionic powers they’ve noticed in their presence. By Committing Effort for the scene as an Instant action, they can see and hear through the senses of a user of a psychic power, gaining an intuitive awareness of their location and treating them as a visible target for purposes of their own abilities. Thus, if they see someone being affected by a telepathy power with no visible source, they can use this ability to briefly share the hidden telepath’s senses. If used on a target that is teleporting, they can perceive the teleporter’s view of their destination. Use on a metamorphically-shaped impostor would reveal the biopsion responsible for the change, and so forth. These shared senses last for only one round and do not interfere with the adept’s other actions."
1,Synthetic Adaptation,0,Core,36,Metapsionics,"This is a particularly esoteric technique, one that requires the adept to have at least Program-0 or Fix-0 skill in order to master. With it, however, the metapsion has learned how to synergize with the quantum
intelligence of a VI or True AI in order to apply Telepathy or Biopsion powers to their inanimate corpus. Only intelligent machines can be affected, as the technique
requires a sentient mind to catalyze the effect. This synergy takes much of its force from the adept. Any System Strain the powers might inflict must be paid by the adept rather than the target."
2,Neural Trap,1~,Core,36,Metapsionics,"Level-2 required

The metapsion allows a hostile psychic into their mental sanctum in order to gain a later advantage. When targeted by a hostile psionic power that allows a save, the metapsion may Commit Effort as an Instant action and voluntarily fail the saving throw, accepting the effect. The next psychic power the user targets at that assailant then allows the victim no saving throw. This technique lasts until the metapsion makes their psychic attack or reclaims their Committed Effort. A hostile psychic may be affected by only one Neural Trap at a time."
2,Psychic Static,1D,Core,37,Metapsionics,"Level-2 required

As an Instant action, the metapsion may Commit Effort
for the day to negate a perceived psychic power. The psychic responsible for the effect may Commit Effort
for the day to resist this negation, otherwise the power
ends and any action used to trigger it is wasted. NPCs who don’t track Effort automatically lose the power. Psychic Static can be applied only once per round to any particular power."
2,Suspended Manifestation,1D,Core,37,Metapsionics,"The metapsion is capable of ""hanging"" a psychic power in their brain, forming the energy patterns and then suspending them in a self-sustaining loop until it's time to trigger their release. The psychic must Commit Effort for the day to hang a power, along with the Effort normally necessary to trigger it. None of this Effort can
be recovered until the power is expended, after which it recovers at its usual speed. Activating the power is an Instant action, or an On Turn action if it allows the target a saving throw of some kind. Only one ability can be held suspended at any one time."
3,Metadimensional Friction,1E,Core,37,Metapsionics,"As a Main Action, the metapsion Commits Effort for
the scene to create localized MES turbulence around a
visible target psychic within 200 meters. Each time the
target Commits Effort or an NPC uses a psychic power, they suffer 1d8 damage per Metapsionics skill level of the adept. Each time the target suffers the damage they can attempt a Mental saving throw to throw off the effect. It lasts no longer than the rest of the scene at most. Only one application of friction can affect a target at once."
3,Concert of Minds,1~,Core,37,Metapsionics,"Level-3 required

As an On Turn action, the metapsion may Commit Effort and form a psychic gestalt with one or more willing psychics within three meters, including up to one other psychic per Metapsion skill level. This gestalt persists as long as the Effort remains committed, regardless of the subsequent distance between psychics. Any member of the gestalt may use any power or technique known by any other member, using the other member’s skill levels as necessary and paying any Effort cost from their own pool. This gestalt shares only psychic power, not thoughts or senses. At the end of each round in which one or more members have used some other member’s powers or abilities, the metapsion must Commit Effort for the scene or the gestalt drops."
3,Psychic Tutelage,0,Core,37,Metapsionics,"An expert metapsion can modulate and temper the metadimensional energy that surges through an untrained psychic's mind. This ""safety buffer"" allows the novice to experiment with their abilities and gradually develop the control they need to channel their powers without causing permanent brain damage. Without this technique, it is virtually impossible to turn a normal with untapped potential into a trained psychic. An adept with Metapsionics-3 skill can train up to ten pupils at once. One with Metapsionics-4 can train up to one hundred. It requires only a week to train a
potential in ways to avoid accidentally triggering their powers and suffering the damage that follows, but actually teaching them to use their powers effectively takes anywhere from one to four years depending on their
natural aptitude and the availability of other psychics
willing to assist the metapsion in the training process."
3,Surge Momentum,1D,Core,37,Metapsionics,"The metapsion's abilities can be reinforced with a degree of metadimensional energy that would cause substantial damage to a less adept mind. Particularly weak or unprepared minds might be completely crushed by the force of the adept's augmented will. The adept must Commit Effort for the day when using a power that normally grants its target a saving throw. The target then suffers a penalty equal to the adept's Metapsionics skill on any saving throw normally granted by the power. If the target's hit die total or character level is less than half the adept's level, rounded up, they automatically fail their saving throw."
4,Impervious Pavis of Will,1D,Core,37,Metapsionics,"Level-4 required

When this technique is learned, the metapsion must choose a discipline. They then become entirely immune to unwanted powers from that discipline; they and their abilities are simply not valid targets for
purposes of that discipline’s powers unless the adept
chooses to be affected. By Committing Effort for the day, they can extend this immunity for a scene to all allies within 50 meters. This technique may be learned more than once, and any shared protection applies to all disciplines negated by the adept."
4,Flawless Mastery,0,Core,37,Metapsionics,"Level-4 required

When this technique is learned, the adept may choose one technique from any discipline they know. That technique no longer requires Effort to be Committed in any way, though techniques that augment it may still exact a cost. If it has a duration based on Committed
Effort then it lasts until the metapsion chooses to end it or is killed. This technique may only be mastered once, though the perfected technique may be changed with a month of meditation and practice."
,Oracle,1D,Core,38,Precognition,"The precog gains a progressively-greater intuitive understanding of their own future. Each invocation of the Oracle technique requires a Main Action and that the user Commit Effort for the day. Once triggered, the adept gets a single brief vision related to the question about the future that they’re asking. This vision is always from their own personal vantage point and never reveals more than a minute of insight, though the psychic processes it almost instantly as part of the power’s use. The GM should answer the question as if the PC were about to perform the act or engage in the investigation pertinent to the question. Thus, if the adept wanted to know what pressing a button would do and the GM knows that it’s connected to a bomb, the psychic might get a vision of sudden death. If the bomb were on a time delay that extended past the time horizon of the oracle, however, the psychic might just see a vision of herself waiting patiently, with nothing happening. Visions should relate to actions and events, not abstract facts. Oracle couldn’t tell a psychic who the crime boss of a slum neighborhood is, for example, but it could give a vision of the psychic caught in the next
bloody riot and the gang boss who’s directing the myriad thugs. It couldn’t reveal the name of a security guard, but it could show the seer the impending moment that the next guard patrol will enter the area the psychic plans to infiltrate. Only the most important or significant information is conveyed by the technique, even if multiple events of interest might transpire during the time horizon. Oracle can only be used on a given question or topic once until the situation changes substantially or a week goes by. The maximum time horizon of the Oracle increases as the adept’s Precognition skill improves.

Level-0: One minute into the future.
Level-1: One day into the future.
Level-2: One week into the future.
Level-3: Three months into the future.
Level-4: One year into the future."
1,Intuitive Response,1E,Core,38,Precognition,"Level-1 required

As an Instant action, the precog can Commit Effort for the scene just before they roll Initiative. Their Initiative score is treated as one better than anyone else’s involved in the scene. If another participant has this power, roll Initiative normally to determine which of them goes first, and then the rest of the combatants act. This ability cannot be used if the precog has been surprised."
1,Terminal Reflection,1D,Core,39,Precognition,"Level-1 required

The psychic’s Oracle power automatically triggers as an
Instant action moments before some unexpected danger or ambush, giving the precog a brief vision of the impending hazard. This warning comes just in time to avoid springing a trap or to negate combat surprise for the precog and their companions. If the psychic does not immediately Commit Effort for the day, this sense goes numb and this technique cannot be used for the rest of the day."
2,Alternate Outcome,1D,Core,39,Precognition,"Level-2 required

The precog can sense impending failure and attempt to salvage the action. As an Instant action, the precog can target a visible ally or their own self and Commit Effort for the day to allow the target to reroll a failed hit roll, saving throw, or skill check, taking the better of the two rolls. This power disrupts delicate lines of probability, however, and cannot be used on any given target more than once a day."
2,Destiny's Shield,1D,Core,39,Precognition,"Level-2 required

The precog observes an incoming injury and tries to find an alternate future in which the attack misses. As an Instant action, the precog can Commit Effort for the day to force an attacker to reroll a successful hit roll. This technique only works on attacks against the psychic’s person, not against attacks aimed at a vehicle they’re occupying or harm that doesn’t involve an attack roll. This technique can be used only once per incoming attack."
3,Anguished Vision,1D,Core,39,Precognition,"The adept's precognition is sophisticated enough to clearly foresee several seconds into the future. As an Instant action, the psychic may Commit Effort for the day and declare that what they have just done or seen is a vision of the immediate future. Time rolls back to the start of the initiative count in a combat turn, or six seconds earlier if out of combat. Nothing that happened during that round has really come to pass yet. This ability is tremendously draining, and can be used only once per day."
3,Cursed Luck,1E,Core,39,Precognition,"Level-3 required

Negative probabilities are woven tightly around a visible animate target, including robots and animals but not including vehicles. Triggering this technique requires a Main Action and Committing Effort for the scene. The target must roll any attack rolls, damage rolls, skill checks and saving rolls twice and take the worst result each time. Any attempts to hit the target or damage dice rolled against it may be rolled twice and the better result taken. Intelligent targets can make a Mental saving throw at the end of each round to throw off the effect; this save is not penalized by the power."
3,Forced Outcome,1E,Core,39,Precognition,"Level-3 required

Through careful manipulation of probability, the adept can influence random physical events in their vicinity. Triggering this technique requires a Main Action and
Committing Effort for the scene. Any simple, random
mechanical outcome can be completely controlled for the scene, such as a roulette wheel or the order of a deck of shuffled cards. Any other physical event in the area that seems not-entirely-implausible may be made to occur by this technique, provided it doesn’t involve more a few objects and doesn’t require human involvement. The GM decides what random events are and are not adequately possible. Anything more than one unusual coincidence or chance per scene is likely impossible to produce."
4,Not My Time,1D,Core,39,Precognition,"Level-4 required

The precog instinctively wrenches the lines of probability away from futures in which they are about to die.
This technique triggers automatically when the precog is about to die, provided they can Commit Effort for the day. On triggering, random events somehow conspire to leave the precog alive, even if outrageous coincidences and ridiculous luck are required. Provided the precog doesn’t intentionally thrust herself back into danger, their life is secured for the next few minutes at least, though there’s no guarantee the psychic will survive intact in mind or body. This technique can trigger no more often than once per week."
4,Prophecy,1~,Core,39,Precognition,"Level-4 required

The power of the precog extends to dictating future
events that directly involve them. The precog may make one prediction involving them personally within the next year. Provided they take reasonable measures to enable this prediction, no direct resistance is mounted by an enemy, and that the prediction doesn’t seem highly improbable to the GM, it will come to pass. The adept must Commit Effort when this power is used,and the Effort remains Committed until the prophecy comes to pass or is abandoned. This ability cannot be used more than once per month and only one prophecy may be active at a time."
,Telekinetic Manipulation,1E,Core,40,Telekinesis,"The adept may Commit Effort for the scene as a Main Action to direct telekinetic force toward an object or person within unaided visual range or with tactile contact with the psychic. The strength and precision of the force increases with the expertise of the psychic.

This force isn’t responsive enough to be usable as a weapon without further refinement of technique, and
cannot cause damage to mobile targets. If used to crush
or harm immobile unliving objects, it does 1d6 damage per skill level of the psychic. A telekinetic force can be maintained over multiple rounds without expending further actions, such as holding a metal platform in place under a group of allies, but the psychic cannot use this technique on a second object until they release the first.

Level-0: The psychic can exert force as if with one hand and their own physical strength.

Level-1: The psychic can manipulate objects as if with
both hands and can lift up to two hundred kilograms with this ability.

Level-2: The psychic can lift or manipulate up to four hundred kilograms and blast a human-sized hole in structures of light wooden construction or lighter as a Main Action.

Level-3: The psychic can manipulate up to eight hundred kilograms and can affect as many individual objects at once as they have Telekinesis skill levels.

Level-4: The psychic can manipulate up to a metric ton and can smash human-sized holes in TL4-constructed exterior walls, light stone walls, or similar barriers as a Main Action."
1,Telekinetic Armory,1~,Core,40,Telekinesis,"Level-1 required

The adept may Commit Effort as an On Turn action to create weapons and armor out of telekinetic force. These weapons can mimic Light or Heavy melee weapons, or be projected as if by a burst-firing combat rifle. Attack rolls use the better of the psychic’s Dexterity, Wisdom, or Constitution modifiers, and add the user’s Telekinesis skill level to the hit roll in place of Shoot or Stab. Armor may be created as part of this power, granting the psychic a base armor class equal to 16 plus their Telekinesis skill level. This armor does not stack with conventional armor, but Dexterity modifies it as usual. The weapons and armor continue to exist as long as the Effort remains committed, and may be invisible or visible at the psychic’s discretion."
1,Kinetic Transversal,1~,Core,40,Telekinesis,"Level-1 required

The adept may Commit Effort as an On Turn action to move freely over vertical or overhanging surfaces as if they were flat ground, crossing any solid surface strong enough to bear five kilos of weight. They can also move over liquids at their full movement rate. This movement ability lasts as long as the Effort remains committed."
1,Pressure Field,1E,Core,40,Telekinesis,"As an Instant action, the adept can manifest a protective force skin around their person equivalent to a vacc suit, maintaining pressure and temperature even in hard
vacuum conditions. They can ignore temperatures at a range of plus or minus 100 degrees Celsius and automatically pressurize thin atmospheres for breathability, or filter particulates or airborn toxins. By Committing Effort for the scene, they can shield up to six comrades. This lasts until the user can and does reclaim the Effort."
2,Impact Sump,1D,Core,40,Telekinesis,"Level-2 required

The adept may Commit Effort for the day as an Instant
action to negate a single instance of physical damage.

This ability is too taxing to be used more than once per scene, but it can be triggered after damage is rolled."
2,Slip Field,1E,Core,40,Telekinesis,"As a Main Action, the psychic Commits Effort for the scene and decreases the friction at a point in sight up to ten meters in diameter, making it extremely difficult for enemies to move from their current position. All
chosen targets must make an Evasion saving throw or fall prone, becoming unable to stand up or move more than a meter per Move action taken. If used against a ground vehicle, the driver must make a Dex/Pilot skill check at a difficulty of 8 plus the adept’s Telekinesis skill or go out of control, driving directly forward for a round and crashing into any obstacles. Targets who
save are immune to this technique for the scene."
2,Telekinetic Expertise,0,Core,41,Telekinesis,The adept has become familiar enough with the manipulation of telekinetic force that they may now use Telekinetic Manipulation without Committing Effort.
2,Thermokinesis,1E,Core,41,Telekinesis,"Telekinetic power involves kinetic energy, but a sufficiently sophisticated grip on motion can be used to agitate the molecules of an inanimate object and cause it to melt or burst into flame. Similar focus can chill or freeze such substances. Applying Thermokinesis to a target requires that the adept Commit Effort for the scene as a Main Action. Thermokinesis cannot affect objects larger than the adept could lift with their Telekinetic Manipulation. As with other telekinetic powers, this ability does not work on objects being held or used by intelligent creatures. Non-sentient robots take 1d8 damage per level of Telekinesis skill each time this technique is
applied to them."
3,Telekinetic Ram,1E,Core,41,Telekinesis,"As a Main Action, the psychic can Commit Effort for the scene to target a tremendous, uncontrolled burst of force at a single target within sight. This burst requires some time to detonate, however, and will only go off at the end of the next round. Targets of this technique are aware of an oppressive, electrical tingling in the air and are apt to instinctively move; this technique is thus generally useless against any target that is not entirely immobile, as any movement of a chosen target disrupts the ram. Once the ram detonates, however, it is sufficient to destroy any immobile civilian vehicle, create a five-meter hole in anything short of hardened military
fortifications, or inflict 5d12 damage on anything else as if it were struck by a Heavy weapon."
3,Reactive Telekinesis,1E,Core,41,Telekinesis,"As an Instant, the psychic can Commit Effort for the scene whenever an assailant misses them with a physical attack. The attack is then reflected back against the assailant, who must reroll the attack against their own person twice. If either roll hits, the assailant suffers damage from their own attack. If both rolls hit, the damage is the maximum possible."
3,Tangible Force Construct,1E,Core,41,Telekinesis,"As an On Turn action, the psychic can Commit Effort
for the scene to create a telekinetic force construct at a
visible point, provided it can fit within a three-meter cube. The force construct can be shaped in any way the psychic wishes, and can remain fixed in its location without external supports if desired. It is as sturdy as a TL4 construction and may be visible or invisible at the adept’s choice. The construct lasts until the end of the scene, until the psychic dispels it, or until it is smashed
with 20 points of damage against AC 10."
4,Force Puppetry,1D,Core,41,Telekinesis,"As a Main Action, the telekinetic can Commit Effort for
the day to suborn a visible target’s mobility, whether
robotic, vehicular, or human, provided it’s no larger than a ground car. A sapient victim can make a Mental saving throw to resist the psychic onslaught; on a failure, they lose control of their physical actions. If not piloted by the telekinetic, the target remains motionless or continues on its current direction of travel. If the
telekinetic spends a Main Action to control them, they
can be made to perform any physical action that is not
directly suicidal, using the psychic’s skill levels and hit
bonus for any attacks or skill checks they might make. The puppetry lasts until the end of the scene, until the target leaves the psychic’s sight, or until a sapient target believes that their action or inaction is about to get them killed. The psychic’s control is fine enough to achieve even very delicate physical motions, but it is not good enough to control the target’s speech- though
it can keep them silent."
4,Telekinetic Glide,1~,Core,41,Telekinesis,"As an Instant action, the telekinetic can Commit Effort
to begin flying, and may extend this effect to up to a half-dozen unresisting, human-sized allies within 30 meters. While flying, the psychic can move at twice
their normal movement rate in any direction They can plunge earthward at up to terminal velocity without harm, and even orbital insertions are survivable with this power if a vacc suit is available or the Pressure Field
technique is used. Allies must end their turns within 30 meters of the psychic to maintain this flight. As an Instant, this power may be triggered in time to negate falling damage. The flight lasts for as long as the Effort remains Committed."
,Telepathic Contact,1D,Core,42,Telepathy,"The telepath can obtain a progressively-deeper understanding of a sentient target’s thoughts. The target must be visible or otherwise perceptible to the telepath’s unaided senses. Opening a contact requires the telepath to Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action, and the contact lasts for a scene at most unless augmented by other techniques. The depth of contact that can be made depends on the psychic’s Telepathy skill. A single contact can use any or all of the effects permitted to a telepath of the user’s skill level. Basic forms of contact do not allow for a saving throw, though more advanced probes allow the target to make a Mental saving throw to resist. On a success, no form of of this technique that allows a save can be used on them for the rest of the scene.

Level-0: Observe emotional states in a target. Intense emotions provide a single word or image related to the focus of the feelings.

Level-1: A shallow gestalt with the target’s language centers allows the telepath to understand any form of communication made by the target. If the psychic has the requisite body parts to speak the target’s language, they can communicate with it in turn.

Level-2: The psychic’s awareness of the target’s surface cognition is sophisticated enough to read their current thoughts, though it can’t pick up memories or non-obvious connections. The target gets a Mental saving throw to resist this.

Level-3: The psychic can drill down into the target’s memory to get a one or two-sentence answer to any single question they ask, or receive a single answering vision of the target’s recollections. The target can attempt a Mental saving throw to resist this power, and whether or not it succeeds the contact is automatically ended. It can be re-established, but only by activating this technique again.

Level-4: The psychic can get a full and nuanced awareness of everything the target can remember about a particular topic. The target can attempt a Mental saving throw to resist this power, and whether or not it succeeds the contact is automatically ended. It can be re-established, but only by activating this technique again."
1,Facile Mind,1E,Core,42,Telepathy,"Level-1 required

The telepath is practiced at opening a Telepathic Contact, and need only Commit Effort for the scene to do so, instead of Committing Effort for the day. If contacting an ally who has practiced the process with the psychic for at least a week, opening the contact normally requires no Effort at all. In both cases, if the telepath chooses to Commit Effort for the day, they can open a Telepathic Contact as an Instant action rather than a Main Action."
1,Transmit Thought,0,Core,43,Telepathy,"Level-1 required

The telepath can send thoughts and images over a Telepathic Contact, allowing two-way communication as an Instant action when desired. An unwilling target may always reject this communication."
2,Supress Cognition,1E,Core,43,Telepathy,"Suppress Cognition: Level-2 required

Through intense focus, the telepath can make the target of a Telepathic Contact simply not think about something, whether that’s the presence of the telepath, the possibility of committing violence, the absence of important documentation, or any other single potential action or one specific person. This technique requires the psychic to Commit Effort for the scene as a Main Action. The target gets a Mental saving throw to resist this power and become immune to it for the scene. If failed, the thought remains unthinkable for the rest of the scene unless the target perceives physical danger or a traumatic threat to something they prize highly. In that case, the block instantly dissolves and cannot be re-established during the scene. Once the effect ends, the target will remain oblivious to their temporary fugue unless it is brought to their attention somehow."
2,Far Thought,0,Core,43,Telepathy,"Level-2 required

Once a telepath has made a Telepathic Contact with a target, they can thereafter activate the technique whenever that target is within 100 kilometers, whether or not the psychic knows where they are. At Telepathy-3 the range increases to 1,000 kilometers, and at Telepathy-4 it extends over an entire planet and up to orbital distances. This distant connection is tenuous, however, and the psychic cannot use any technique through it that would allow the target a saving throw to resist."
3,Reflex Response,1D,Core,43,Telepathy,"Level-3 required

As a Main Action, the telepath can Commit Effort for the day to force a sudden, irrational impulse into the target of a Telepathic Contact. The target may make a Mental saving throw to resist; on a failure, they will use their next available action to carry out the impulse to the best of their ability. This impulse cannot be self-injurious or harmful to a loved one, but it can be foolish, reckless, or harmful to others. The target may not understand why they have done the action, but will attempt to rationalize it as their own choice unless they’re primed to blame telepathic interference."
3,Telepathic Assault,1D,Core,43,Telepathy,"Level-3 required

The telepath Commits Effort for the scene as a Main Action to force a wave of metadimensional energy through the brain of a Telepathic Contact target. The assault does 6d6 damage, or 9d6 damage if the telepath has Telepathy-4 skill. The target may make a Mental saving throw to halve the damage. This assault cannot kill a target, but can knock them unconscious for an hour if they’re reduced to zero hit points, after which they wake up with one hit point. A victim cannot be targeted by a Telepathic Assault more than once per scene."
4,Memory Editing,1D,Core,43,Telepathy,"Level-4 required

The telepath can make simple edits to the memory of a target currently linked by a Telepathic Contact. Events of no more than 24 hours in duration can be erased from memory, conversations can be created or changed, new events can be added to a day, or other similar alterations made. The psychic can make these changes as a Main Action by Committing Effort for the day. If the psychic doesn’t have a good understanding of the memories they’re changing, such as might be granted by the level-4 degree of Telepathic Contact, the edits they make may not fit well. The target gets a Mental saving throw to resist editing for the rest of the scene, but on a failure, they will not notice the changed memories until given a reason to recollect them."
4,Unity of Thought,0,Core,43,Telepathy,"Level-4 required

The telepath becomes exceptionally skilled at weaving together multiple allied minds. When they establish a Telepathic Contact with a willing ally they may bind up to six willing participants into the same contact without further Effort. This multi-person link is relatively shallow, and allows only the Instant exchange of thoughts, images, and sensory impressions. While under its effect, every participant knows the exact location and condition of all others, and uses the best Initiative roll of any of them if combat commences. At the table, up to five minutes of discussion and coordination among the players can be arranged each round without incurring delays for the PCs. The telepathic link lasts as long as the psychic maintains the contact and has a range that extends to any point within a solar system."
,Personal Apportation,1E,Core,44,Teleportation,"The teleporter can translocate himself to another location they have either occupied before or can see with their unaided vision. Locations are fixed in reference to the nearest major gravity well. For example, it is not possible to teleport to the cockpit of a distant moving vehicle you once occupied, but you can teleport to another point on a planet’s surface even though the planet has since moved far through the stellar void. The core technique allows the teleporter to move himself and any mass he is able to carry with his own natural strength. Unwilling targets cannot be carried along, and willing ones must be touched. A teleporter can leave any clothing, shackles, adhesions, or other matter behind when he teleports, but he cannot leave behind matter that has been inserted into his body, such as cybernetics or shrapnel. Matter cannot be partially left behind. A teleporter will instinctively abort any apportation that would leave them embedded in a solid object or in an environment of imminent physical danger. Any Committed Effort on such aborted jumps is wasted, as is any action spent triggering the power. The maximum range of Personal Apportation depends on the teleporter’s skill level. Teleporting with Personal Apportation counts as a Main Action and requires that the psychic Commit Effort for the scene.

Level-0: 10 meters

Level-1: 100 meters

Level-2: 10 kilometers

Level-3: 1,000 kilometers

Level-4: Anywhere on a planet’s surface or near orbit."
1,Proficient Apportation,0,Core,44,Teleportation,"Personal Apportation now counts as a Move action,
though it still can be performed only once per round. Apportations of 10 meters or less no longer require Effort to be Committed, though any augments to the technique must still be paid for normally."
1,Spatial Awareness,1~,Core,44,Teleportation,"Level-1 required

The psychic may Commit Effort as an On Turn action to gain an intuitive awareness of their physical surroundings. The sense is roughly equivalent to sight out to 100 meters, though it cannot read text or distinguish colors. It is blocked by solid objects but is unimpeded by darkness, mist, blinding light, holograms, or optical illusions. The sense lasts as long as the Effort remains Committed."
2,Burdened Apportation,1D,Core,45,Teleportation,"Level-2 required

The psychic can carry willing companions with them when using Personal Apportation. Up to three human-sized companions and their man-portable gear may be carried per skill level in Teleportation. Allies must be within 3 meters of the teleporter to be carried along. Ordinary inert matter cannot be carried along unless the psychic is touching it or it’s being carried by an ally affected by this power. If carrying inert mass, up to two hundred kilos of objects can be carried per skill level. Using this technique increases the Effort cost of Personal Apportation, requiring that an extra point of Effort be Committed for the day."
2,Perceptive Dislocation,1D,Core,45,Teleportation,"Commit Effort for the day to sense any location the psychic could teleport to. The psychic perceives the location as if there, lasting for fifteen minutes at most."
2,Spatial Synchrony Mandala,0,Core,45,Teleportation,"Level-2 required

The psychic imprints a particular object or person on their psionic awareness. Provided the object is relatively intact and in range of their Personal Apportation, the psychic always knows its exact location and can teleport to within three meters of it with Personal Apportation even if it has moved from its original location. Imprinting an object requires an hour’s meditation, and only one object can be imprinted at a time. If imprinting on a person, the target must be willing and cooperative to make the imprint. Objects must be at least one kilogram in mass to be effectively tracked."
3,Effortless Apportation,0,Core,45,Teleportation,"Level-3 required

The psychic does not need to Commit Effort to use Personal Apportation. If the technique is augmented by other techniques that come with their own extra cost, however, this extra cost must still be paid."
3,Stutterjump,1~,Core,45,Teleportation,"Level-3 required

The psychic can instinctively micro-teleport away from incoming danger. As an On Turn action they may Commit Effort to begin shifting their spatial position away from attacks, gaining a base armor class of 20 so long as the Effort remains Committed. This armor class is not modified by physical armor or Dexterity modifiers, and the micro-jumps do not significantly move the psychic from their current location. While Stutterjump is active, as an Instant action the adept may Commit Effort for the day to negate a successful hit by a weapon attack, even after damage has been rolled. This reflexive defensive jump may be used only once per scene and leaves the psychic just outside the radius of explosions or other area-effect attacks."
3,Rift Reduplication,1D,Core,45,Teleportation,"Expert teleporters can be infuriatingly difficult to pin down. By Committing an additional Effort for the day as an Instant action, the adept can use Personal Apportation as an On Turn action, even if they've already used it once this round. Apporting itself costs whatever Effort it normally would, in addition to any techniques that
augment it. Rift Reduplication can only be triggered once
per round. If the adept uses their powers to teleport into a location, perform an action, and then use Rift Reduplication to teleport back out, onlookers in the area will not have time to react to their action or attack the adept unless the onlookers have held their action explicitly
to counter the psychic. Enemies who hold their action
this way waste it entirely if the psychic does not give them a chance to attack or otherwise interfere. Such a lightning strike may be surprising to onlookers, but it doesn't allow enough preparation time to count as a
surprise attack as described on page XX."
4,Deep Intrusion,1D,Core,45,Teleportation,"Level-4 required

The adept can use Personal Apportation to blind-teleport into a building, structure, vehicle, or spaceship visible to them, including spaceships close enough to engage in conventional ship-to-ship combat. They intuitively seek out a space large enough to hold them and without immediate environmental hazards, but cannot control their precise destination. Using this technique in conjunction with Personal Apportation is very draining to the psychic, and requires that they Commit an additional Effort point for the day."
4,Offensive Apportation,1D,Core,45,Teleportation,"Level-4 required

The psychic can use Personal Apportation as a Main Action to teleport an unwilling target, provided the user can make physical contact with them. Contact with an unsuspecting or incapacitated target is automatic, while touching a resisting enemy requires a Punch hit roll with a bonus equal to the psychic’s Teleportation skill. If the psychic does not use the Burdened Apportation technique then only the target is teleported; otherwise the user may go along with them. The psychic cannot teleport a target to any location they could not teleport to, including locations of imminent environmental danger, such as high in the air, into a windowless tomb, or into the middle of a sea. A conscious, resisting target can make a Mental saving throw to forcibly abort the teleportation, rolling at a penalty equal to the psychic’s Teleportation skill. Use of this technique adds to the cost of Personal Apportation, requiring the psychic Commit an additional point of Effort for the day whether the touch hits or not."
