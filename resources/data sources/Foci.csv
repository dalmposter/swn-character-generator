When you roll initiative, roll twice and take the best result.",You always act first in a combat round unless someone else involved is also this Alert.,You are keenly aware of your surroundings and virtually impossible to take unaware. You have an instinctive alacrity of response that helps you act before less wary persons can think to move.

You may add your Stab skill level to a melee or thrown weapon’s damage roll or Shock damage, if any.","Your melee and thrown weapons count as TL4 weapons for the purpose of overcoming advanced armors. Even on a miss with a melee weapon, you do 1d4 damage to the target. This automatic damage doesn’t apply to thrown weapons.","You have an unusual competence with thrown weapons and melee attacks. This focus’ benefits do not apply to unarmed attacks or projectile weapons. For thrown weapons, you can’t use the benefits of the Armsman focus at the same time as Gunslinger."
Assassin,"Gain Sneak as a bonus skill. You can conceal an object no larger than a knife or pistol from anything less invasive than a strip search, including normal TL4 passive weapon detectors. You can draw or produce this object as an Instant action, and your point-blank ranged attacks with it cannot miss the target.","You can take a Move action on the same round as you make an assassination attempt, closing rapidly with a target before you attack.

advantages in carrying out a surprise attack as described
in the rules on page XX."
Authority,"Gain Lead as a bonus skill. Once per day, you can make a request from an NPC who is not openly hostile to you, rolling a Cha/Lead skill check at a difficulty of the NPC's Morale score.

Followers will not act against your interests unless under extreme pressure.,"You have an uncanny kind of charisma about you, one that makes others instinctively follow your instructions and further your causes. At level 1, this is a knack of charm and personal magnetism, while level 2 might suggest latent telepathic influence or transhuman memetic hacking augmentations. Where this focus refers to followers, it means NPCs who have voluntarily chosen to be in your service. PCs never count as followers."
Close Combatant,"Gain any combat skill as a bonus skill. You can use pistol-sized ranged weapons in melee without suffering penalties for the proximity of melee attackers. You ignore Shock damage from melee assailants, even if you're unarmored at the time.",The Shock damage from your melee attacks treats all targets as if they were AC 10.

Connected,"Gain Connect as a bonus skill. If you’ve spent at least a week in a not-entirely-hostile location, you’ll have built a web of contacts willing to do favors for you that are no more than mildly illegal. You can call on one favor per game day and the GM decides how far they’ll go for you.","As above. Once per game session, if it’s not entirely implausible, you meet someone you know who is willing to do modest favors for you. You can decide when and where you want to meet this person, but the GM decides who they are and what they can do for you.","You’re remarkably gifted at making friends and forging ties with the people around you. Wherever you go, you always seem to know somebody useful to your ends."

This ability can't save you from Heavy weapons or similar trauma.",You are surprisingly hard to kill.

Diplomat,"You speak all the languages common to the sector and can learn new ones to a workable level in a week, becoming fluent in a month. Reroll 1s on any skill check related to negotiation or diplomacy.","Once per game session, shift an intelligent NPC’s reaction roll one step closer to friendly if you can talk to them for at least thirty seconds.","You know how to get your way in personal negotiations, and can manipulate the attitudes of those around you.

Gunslinger,"Gain Shoot as a bonus skill. You can draw or holster a Stowed ranged weapon as a free action. You may add your Shoot skill level to a ranged weapon’s damage roll or Shock damage, if any.","You can reload a ranged weapon as an On Turn action if it takes no more than one round to reload. Even on a miss with a Shoot attack, you do an unmodified 1d4 damage.","You have a gift with a gun. While this talent most commonly applies to slugthrowers or energy weapons, it is also applicable to thrown weapons, bows, or other ranged weapons that can be used with the Shoot skill. For thrown weapons, you can’t use the benefits of the Armsman focus at the same time as Gunslinger."
Hacker,"Gain Program as a bonus skill. When attempting to hack a database or computerized system, roll 3d6 on the skill check and drop the lowest die.",Your hack duration increases from 1d4 plus your Program skill in rounds to that many minutes. You have an instinctive understanding of the tech; you never need to learn the data protocols for a strange system and are always treated as familiar with it.,You have a remarkable fluency with digital security measures and standard encryption methods. You know how to make computerized systems obey you until their automatic failsafes come down on your control.
Healer,"Gain Heal as a bonus skill. You may attempt to stabilize one adjacent person per round as an On Turn action. When rolling Heal skill checks, roll 3d6 and drop the lowest die.","Stims or other technological healing devices applied by you heal twice as many hit points as normal.

Henchkeeper,"You can acquire henchmen within 24 hours of arriving in a community, assuming anyone is suitable hench material. These henchmen will not fight except to save their own lives, but will escort you on adventures and risk great danger to help you. Most henchmen will be treated as Normal Humans from the Xenobestiary section of the book. You can have one henchmen at a time for every three character levels you have, rounded up. You can release henchmen with no hard feelings at any plausible time and pick them back up later should you be without a current henchman.","Your henchmen are remarkably loyal and determined, and will fight for you against anything but clearly overwhelming odds. Whether through natural competence or their devotion to you, they're treated as Normal Soldiers or Skilled Workers from the Xenobestiary section.","You have an distinct knack for picking up lost souls who willingly do your bidding. You might induce them with promises of money, power, excitement, sex, or some other prize that you may or may not eventually grant. A henchman obtained with this focus will serve in loyal fashion until clearly betrayed or placed in unacceptable danger. Henchmen are never ""important"" people in their society, and are usually marginal sorts, outcasts, the desperate, or other persons with few options.

You can use more conventional pay or inducements to acquire additional henchmen, but these extra hirelings are no more loyal or competent than your pay and treatment can purchase."
Ironhide,"You have an innate armor class of 15 plus half your character level, rounded up.",Your abilities are so effective that they render you immune to unarmed attacks or primitive melee weapons as if you wore powered armor.,"Whether through uncanny reflexes, remarkable luck, gengineered skin fibers, or subtle telekinetic shielding, you have natural defenses equivalent to high-quality combat armor.

Your maximum Effort increases by one.","When you advance a level, the bonus psychic skill you chose automatically gets one skill point put toward increasing it or purchasing a technique from it. You may save these points for later, if more are required to raise the skill or buy a particular technique. These points are awarded retroactively if you take this focus level later in the game.","You’ve had special training in a particular psychic discipline. You must be a Psychic or have taken the Partial Psychic class option as an Adventurer to pick this focus. In the latter case, you can only take training in the discipline you initially chose as a Partial Psychic. As with most foci, this focus can be taken only once."
Savage Fray,Gain Stab as a bonus skill. All enemies adjacent to you at the end of your turn whom you have not attacked suffer the Shock damage of your weapon if their armor class is not too high to be affected.,"After suffering your first melee hit in a round, any further melee attacks from other assailants automatically miss you. If the attacker who hits you has multiple attacks, they may attempt all of them, but other foes around you simply miss.","You are a whirlwind of bloody havoc in melee combat, and can survive being surrounded far better than most combatants."
Shocking Assault,"Gain any combat skill as a bonus. The Shock damage of your weapon treats all targets as if they were AC 10, assuming your weapon is capable of harming the target in the first place.","As above, but you gain a +2 bonus to the Shock damage rating of all melee weapons you use. Your regular hits with a weapon never do less damage than this Shock would do on a miss.",You’re extremely dangerous to enemies around you. The ferocity of your melee attacks stresses and distracts enemies even when your blows don't draw blood.
Sniper,"Gain Shoot as a bonus skill. When making a surprise attack skill check with firearms or bows, roll 3d6 and drop the lowest die.","A target hit by your sniping attempt takes a -4 penalty on the Physical saving throw to avoid immediate mortal injury.

Starfarer,Gain Pilot as a bonus skill. You automatically succeed at all spike drill-related skill checks of difficulty 10 or less.,"Double your Pilot skill for all spike drill-related skill checks. Spike drives of ships you navigate are treated as one level higher; thus, a drive-1 is treated as a drive-2, up to a maximum of drive-7. Spike drills you personally oversee take only half the time they would otherwise require.","You are an expert in the plotting and execution of interstellar spike drills. While most experienced pilots can manage conventional drills along well-charted spike routes, you have the knack for forging new drill paths and cutting courses too dangerous for lesser navigators."
Tinker,"Gain Fix as a bonus skill. Your Maintenance score is doubled, allowing you to maintain twice as many mods. Mods cost only half their usual price in credits, though pretech salvage requirements remain the same.","Your Fix skill is treated as one level higher for purposes of building and maintaining mods and calculating your Maintenance score.

At level-2 they do 1d10, level-3 does 1d12, and level-4 does 2d8. At Punch-1 or better, they have the Shock quality equal to 1 plus your Punch skill against AC 15 or less. While you normally add your Punch skill level to any unarmed damage, don't add it twice to this Shock damage.","You know locks and twists that use powered servos against their wearer. Your unarmed attacks count as TL4 weapons for the purpose of overcoming advanced armors. Even on a miss with a Punch attack, you do an unmodified 1d6 damage.","Your empty hands are more dangerous than knives and guns in the grip of the less gifted. Your unarmed attacks are counted as melee weapons when it comes to binding up opponents wielding rifles and similar long arms, though you need at least one hand free to do so."
Wanderer,"Gain Survive as a bonus skill. You can convey basic ideas in all the common languages of the sector. You can always find free transport to a desired destination for yourself and a small group of your friends provided any traffic goes to the place. Finding this transport takes no more than an hour, but it may not be a strictly legitimate means of travel and may require working passage.","You can forge, scrounge, or snag travel papers and identification for the party with 1d6 hours of work. These papers and permits will stand up to ordinary scrutiny, but require an opposed Int/ Administer versus Wis/Notice check if examined by an official while the PC is actually wanted by the state for some crime. When finding transport for the party, the transportation always makes the trip at least as fast as a dedicated charter would.","Your hero gets around. As part of a life on the road, they've mastered a number of tricks for ensuring their mobility and surviving the inevitable difficulties of a vagabond existence."
