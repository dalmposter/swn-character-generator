export const fociRulesExcerptShort = "Choose your foci, representing the side talents or particular specializations of your hero. You can pick one level of a focus of your choice. Characters with the Expert class or the Partial Expert feature of the Adventurer class get one level of a non-combat, non-psychic focus for free in addition to this. They can spend both levels on the same focus, starting with level 2 in it if they wish. Characters with the Warrior class or Partial Warrior feature of the Adventurer class can do the same in choosing one level of a combat focus.";
export const fociRulesExcerptLong = "Every member of a class has certain baseline abilities that let them do well at their role. Warriors are always good combatants, Experts are always gifted with their skills, and Psychics always have a few pertinent psionic abilities. Aside from these baseline abilities, characters also have a focus.A focus is an additional knack, perk, or aptitude that a hero has, one that grants them certain benefits in play. Each focus has one or more levels of increasinglystrong effect. For example, someone with level 1 in the Die Hard focus gains two extra maximum hit points each level and automatically stabilizes after a mortal wound, while someone with level 2 can negate the first injury they suffer each day that would incapacitate or kill them. The benefits of a focus stack, so if you take level 2 in one, you get all the benefits from level 1 as well.Any character can pick any focus, and it doesn’t have to “match” the class you selected. A Psychic can choose the Unarmed Combatant focus for fistic prowess, while a Warrior might have enough experience with battlefield trauma to qualify as a Healer. The only obligation is that you explain how your hero picked up the training or exhibited their natural aptitude for the focus.";
