export const classRulesExcerptLong = "In one way or another, your character is cut out for adventure. Your hero might be a veteran combatant, skilled with blade or laser, or they might be a psychic gifted with uncanny abilities. It’s just as possible that they could have remarkable talents as a pilot, or be the smoothest grifter in the hiveslum they grew up in. Whatever their particular background, your hero’s primary focus is their class.Your class represents your hero’s best set of tools for dealing with their problems. They’re the skills and capabilities that they’re most likely to turn to to resolve a problem, but not their only tools. A Psychic can still shoot a gun and a Warrior can try to fasttalk a mark.Choosing a class helps ensure that your hero is good at something that might contribute to a bold party of interstellar adventurers. Experts always have a knack at exercising noncombat skills, Warriors are always good in a scrap, and Psychics always have a unique power or two to employ at need. Your hero might have led a quiet life as a starport customs clerk until recently, but their natural talents will ensure that they can do something that the rest of the group will find useful.";
