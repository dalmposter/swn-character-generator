export const backgroundsRulesExcerptShort = "Pick a background from the list on page 9, one that  most  closely  reflects  your  hero’s  past  experiences.  You  gain  the  skill  listed  under  the  background  name  at  level 0,  which  equates  to  an ordinary working knowledge of it. Decide  whether  to  roll  for  additional  skills  or  pick them. If you pick skills, you can choose two more  skills  from  the  Learning  table  for  your  background, with the exception of entries that say  “Any  Skill”,  which  you  may  not  pick.  You  cannot  pick  entries  from  the  Growth  table.  If  you’re not sure what to pick, just take the “Quick Skills”  listed  for  your  background  at  level 0,  which include your background’s beginning skill. If you choose to roll for your skills, you can roll up to  three  times,  dividing  up  your  rolls  between  the  Growth  and  Learning  tables  as  you  wish.  When  you  roll  on  the  Growth  table,  some  results  may  say  “+2  Physical”  or  “+2  Mental”.  In  the  former  case,  you  can  add  two  points  to  either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution, or one point  to  two  different  stats.  In  the  latter  case,  you  can  add  two  points  to  either  Intelligence,  Wisdom,  or  Charisma,  or  divide  the  bonus  between two of them.";
export const backgroundsRulesExcerptLong = "Once you pick a background, your hero gains several skills associated with their past. First,  you  get  the  free  skill  associated  with  the  background. Every member of that role or profession needs this skill to function competently, so your hero gets it as well. Next,  you  may  either  pick  two  other  skills  from  the Learning table for your background, or make three random rolls divided between the Growth and Learning tables. If you pick skills, you can select exactly the talents you want for your hero, while going with random rolls allows your character a little wider range of competence and the option of attribute improvements at the cost of perfect control over their development. If you pick skills, you may pick the same skill twice if you wish, to improve its starting proficiency. If you’re not sure what to pick, just take the three skills listed under “Quick Skills” for your background. They’re the ones most critical to the profession.";
