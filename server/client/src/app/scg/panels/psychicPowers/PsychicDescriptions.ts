Someone with a basic, functioning expertise in the skill has level0, while a true master of the art would have level4. Every psychic who obtains level0 proficiency in a discipline gains access to its core technique. Core techniques improve naturally as the psychic improves their skill level. As a psychic improves their skill level in a discipline, they may also learn other techniques, special tricks and abilities they’ve refined through practice. Each time they improve a skill level, they can pick a new technique from that discipline. They cannot “save” technique picks for later.";
