export const psychicRulesExcerptShort = "Psychics can pick two psychic skills from those listed on page 8, while Partial Psychics can pick one. If a Psychic picks the same skill twice, they get it at level1 expertise, and can pick a free level1 technique from those listed for that discipline. Both Psychics and Partial Psychics get the level0 abilities associated with their skills, as described under each discipline they possess. Both also have a maximum Effort score equal to 1 plus their highest psychic skill plus the better of their Wisdom or Constitution modifiers.";
export const psychicRulesExcerptLong = "Psionic powers are divided up into disciplines, each of which has a corresponding skill. Someone with a basic, functioning expertise in the skill has level0, while a true master of the art would have level4. Only psychics can learn psionic skills, and they are most often taught at rigidlydisciplined psychic academies. Attempting to develop these skills without such formalized training is almost invariably lethal to the experimenter, though an exceedingly few natural prodigies sometimes intuitively grasp their principles. Even fewer of these gifted naturals are able to express their understanding in a coherent, teachable form.\n\nEvery psychic who obtains level0 proficiency in a discipline gains access to its core technique. This technique varies depending on the discipline, whether it’s physical translocation with Teleportation or tissue repair with Biopsionics. The strength of the ability varies with the practitioner’s skill level; the Psychic Succor provided by a biopsionicist with level0 proficiency is much weaker than that provided by someone with level4 expertise. Core techniques improve naturally as the psychic improves their skill level. They do not need to be purchased with skill points or otherwise specially trained.As a psychic improves their skill level in a discipline, they may also learn other techniques, special tricks and abilities they’ve refined through practice. Each time they improve a skill level, they can pick a new technique from that discipline. Most techniques have a minimum skill level associated with them, and the PC can’t pick a technique which requires a higher skill level than they’ve mastered. They also cannot “save” technique picks for later, either. They must be chosen immediately after improving the skill.";
