export const attributesRulesExcerptShort = "Roll your six attributes or assign them from an array,  using  Strength,  Dexterity,  Constitution,  Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Attributes reflect the basic potential of your hero. Roll 3d6 six  times  and  assign  them  in  order,  or  use  an  array of 14, 12, 11, 10, 9, 7 assigned as you wish. If you randomly roll your scores you may then pick one attribute to change to a score of 14.\n\nMark down your attribute modifiers for each score. When rolling dice that are affected by an attribute, you don’t apply the whole score; instead, you apply the attribute modifier. A score of 3 is a 2, 4 - 7 is a 1, 8 - 13 is no modifier, 14 - 17 is +1, and 18 is +2";
export const attributesRulesExcerptLong = "The first step in creating a character is to determine the character’s six attributes. Attributes describe how strong, quick, clever, perceptive, hardy, or charming your hero might be. Attributes are measured by scores ranging from 3 to 18, with 3 reflecting an attribute so weak that the PC is barely fit for adventuring and an 18 marking the maximum possible aptitude for an ordinary human.To generate a character’s attributes, roll 3d6 six times and assign the results in order to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. You may then change one attribute of your choice to 14 if you wish to ensure that your new adventurer is gifted in at least one way.If you prefer not to roll, you may instead assign the following scores to your attributes in any order you wish: 14, 12, 11, 10, 9, and 7. If you assign your scores, you cannot replace one of them with a 14. Once you’ve assigned your attributes, record the modifier for each of them. This modifier is applied to relevant skill checks or other rolls related to the attribute. If your attribute score changes during play, either from some crippling injury or from improvements granted by your background or experience, you should make sure to update any changed modifier.";
